# SDR playground

Toying around on SDRs. Currently trying to intercept LoRa packages over the air.

**receiver**: SDR device, built using SoapySDR on LimeSDR
**lorawan_node**: Built using Zephyr OS on an STM32 L072CZ LRWAN1 devkit. The local setup uses an iC880A on a Raspberry Pi 3 running ChirpStack.
